Lego's "<a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/power-functions/about">Power Functions</a>" product line was discontinued in 2020, in favor of the "<a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/powered-up/about">Powered Up</a>" line. Currently, the only ways to obtain new components from the Power Functions line are by purchasing these original Lego components on the second-hand market, or by purchasing these new components, manufactured by alternative companies such as <a href="https://mouldking.store/shop/mould-king-power-function-parts-v2-0/">Mould King</a>, <a href="https://decadastore.com/products/cada-power-pack-pro-s059-003">CaDA</a> and <a href="https://pt.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-lego-power-function.html">Generics</a>. These can also be found on global e-commerce sites such as <a href="https://aliexpress.com">Aliexpress</a>.
