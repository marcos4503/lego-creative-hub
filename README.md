# What is Lego Power Functions?

Lego Power Functions (abbreviated as PF) is a line of electronic components that are compatible and fit into Lego bricks, including Motors, Lights, IR Remote Controls, IR Receivers and different types of Battery Boxes. These components operate in the voltage range of 9v or 7.4v and are connectable to each other using cables with Brick-Shaped Connectors.

The main Power Functions components originally manufactured by Lego consist of the following:
