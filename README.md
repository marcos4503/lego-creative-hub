Lego's "<a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/power-functions/about">Power Functions</a>" product line was discontinued in 2018, in favor of the "<a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/powered-up/about">Powered Up</a>" line. Currently, the only ways to obtain new components from the Power Functions line are by purchasing these original Lego components on the second-hand market, or by purchasing these new components, manufactured by alternative companies such as <a href="https://mouldking.store/shop/mould-king-power-function-parts-v2-0/">Mould King</a>, <a href="https://decadastore.com/products/cada-power-pack-pro-s059-003">CaDA</a> and <a href="https://pt.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-lego-power-function.html">Generics</a>. These can also be found on global e-commerce sites such as <a href="https://aliexpress.com">Aliexpress</a>.

# What is Lego Power Functions?

Lego Power Functions (abbreviated as PF) is a line of electronic components that are compatible and fit into Lego bricks, including Motors, Lights, IR Remote Controls, IR Receivers and different types of Battery Boxes. These components operate in the voltage range of 9v or 7.4v and are connectable to each other using cables with Brick-Shaped Connectors.

The main Power Functions components originally manufactured by Lego consist of the following:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="This-Repository/extension.png" width="128px" height="128px"><br>Extension Cable</td>
        <td><img src="This-Repository/switch.png" width="128px" height="128px"><br>Control Switch</td>
        <td><img src="This-Repository/ir-remote-1.png" width="128px" height="128px"><br>IR Speed R. Control</td>
        <td><img src="This-Repository/ir-remote-2.png" width="128px" height="128px"><br>IR Remote Control</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="This-Repository/ir-receiver.png" width="128px" height="128px"><br>IR Receiver</td>
        <td><img src="This-Repository/leds.png" width="128px" height="128px"><br>LED Lights</td>
        <td><img src="This-Repository/xl-motor.png" width="128px" height="128px"><br>XL Motor</td>
        <td><img src="This-Repository/l-motor.png" width="128px" height="128px"><br>L Motor</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="This-Repository/m-motor.png" width="128px" height="128px"><br>M Motor</td>
        <td><img src="This-Repository/e-motor.png" width="128px" height="128px"><br>E Motor</td>
        <td><img src="This-Repository/servo-motor.png" width="128px" height="128px"><br>Servo Motor</td>
        <td><img src="This-Repository/buggy-motor.png" width="128px" height="128px"><br>Buggy Motor</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="This-Repository/train-motor.png" width="128px" height="128px"><br>Train Motor</td>
        <td><img src="This-Repository/aa-battery-box.png" width="128px" height="128px"><br>AA Battery Box</td>
        <td><img src="This-Repository/aaa-battery-box.png" width="128px" height="128px"><br>AAA Battery Box</td>
        <td><img src="This-Repository/rechargeable-battery-box.png" width="128px" height="128px"><br>Rechargeable Batt. Box</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Alternative manufacturers such as Mould King, CaDA and generics, manufacture most of the above components, and also manufacture proprietary components (all compatible with Lego components) such as the following mains:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="This-Repository/l-bb-motor.png" width="128px" height="128px"><br>L Black Burst Motor</td>
        <td><img src="This-Repository/s-motor-23.png" width="128px" height="128px"><br>S 2x3 Motor</td>
        <td><img src="This-Repository/s-motor-24.png" width="128px" height="128px"><br>S 2x4 Motor</td>
        <td><img src="This-Repository/smoker.png" width="128px" height="128px"><br>Smoke Sprayer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="This-Repository/smoker1.png" width="128px" height="128px"><br>Auto Smoke Sprayer</td>
        <td><img src="This-Repository/ble-speaker.png" width="128px" height="128px"><br>Bluetooth LE Speaker</td>
        <td><img src="This-Repository/g-rechargeable-battery-box1.png" width="128px" height="128px"><br>Rechargeable Batt. Box</td>
        <td><img src="This-Repository/g-rechargeable-battery-box2.png" width="128px" height="128px"><br>Rechargeable Batt. Box</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="This-Repository/mk-controller.png" width="128px" height="128px"><br>BT Controller</td>
        <td><img src="This-Repository/mk-receiver.png" width="128px" height="128px"><br>Battery & BT Receiver</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Power Functions are the successors to the "9v System", also from Lego, and were launched on the market in 2007, and discontinued by Lego in 2018, although it continues to be produced by alternative brands such as Mould King, CaDA and other generic brands.

When you combine the components from the Power Functions line, along with other Lego components, such as Beams, Bricks, Arms, Axles, Gears, Wheels, Pneumatic Cylinders, Chains, Belts, Tracks, Suspensions and many other types of components, you can bring to life many and many of your ideas involving mechatronics or even robotics. It is a great hobby and way to study these items.

The videos below gives a good example of how to create something with the Power Function line, in conjunction with other types of Lego components:
