# lego-creative-hub
Lego Creative Hub is an Open Source Hub, a combination of Hardware and Software components that anyone can re-create to use in their Lego Power Functions projects. The goal is to be a COMPLETE Hub, programmable through an App, compatible with sensors/actuators and with all Lego Power Functions components.
